## Is length of answer awarded?

There seems to be no correlation between the length of an answer (displayed as number of characters) and the score the answer gets. I can see two reasons how this could be the case:

* either quality lenghty answers just don't get the recognition they deserve
* or writing lengthy answers takes time and in the mean time other answers already got the bulk of the attention

I'm more inclined toward the second reason. Let's look at the relation between the time it took to reply and the score the reply got.
